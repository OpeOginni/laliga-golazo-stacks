## More ways to flex and use your Golazo Moments

### About Golazo and Golazo Stack

Gozalo Stacks is an extension of the already existing Laliga Golazo community on flow. Moments are plays or actions that happened in real football games in the Spanish Laliga League.

Golazo Stacks was created to be a way for users to create teams of Moments, and further make their collection unique. As an individual Moment might be unique, but put that Moment in a Team/Stack with other Moments then you can create a truely Unique combination.

### Cadence and its Benefits

Golazo Stacks is written with the Cadence Language, the backbone of all systems built on the Flow Blockchain. Buuilding with Cadence was a very nice experience, mostly because of its similarity to Typescript needing you to assert types to variables, you can write clean code without stopping to test everytime, as you are sure of what types you are working with or returning.

Cadence also makes it easy to write good code, as your code wont work if it isn't nice, therefore it is easier to read and understand no matter how large a codebase can be. The capabilities of Cdence is also a large advantage, it is the same capability of Cadence tha allows other users to build Contracts ontop of already deployed contracts enabling other users to add features to Contracts they like.

### Issues Faced Building with Cadence

One Issue I did have when building with Cadence was the lack of relaiable Developer Tools to work with the Language, tools like the Flow CLI and the Cadence Playground are available and are really helpful, but they are not always reliable.

### More on the Idea, Goal and Logic of Golazo Stack

Golazo Stack lets users create a Team or Stack of 5 Moments from their Collection (that is Moments they personally own), Chemistry of the Stack is then calculated, this depends on the Moments that are put in a stack and how connected they are to each other, Moments wit closer connection, like Moments from players in the same team, or players from the same country or moments from the same game, get higher Chemistry Score as they have closer connections to each other. Chemistry can be used to set new types of Challenges for Moment Holders, ( Team or Stack Building Challenges), this idea matches the game feature in the popular game Series FIFA (EAFC). The challenges can be made better, where users use their present Moments o get higher teir moments in turn burning the Moments they used to pass a challenge. This reduces the supply and increases the value and rarity of exisitng Moments.

### Architecture

The Contract Architecture might seem complex, but it has a really simple case. When you decide to create a Stack from Moments you own, the needed attributes of the moments you are creating a Stack of is extracted and saved as the `StackAttributes`, these attributes will be used to make calculations for the Stack Chemistry and will be used to check if your Stack fullfils all requirements of a Challenge. Stacks can also be placed on sale, which is sort of selling Moments in Bulk. Buyers can decide to buy Stacks as they are and will get sent all the Moments & the Stack will be transfered to them, or they can decide to just purchase the Moments only and the Stack will get destroyed. A future plan is to allow users submit Stacks to Contests where if their Stacks reach a Contest requirement, they are rewarded with Moment packs and the Moments in the Stack that was submitted will get Destroyed(Burnt).

### Discussion with Golazo Community and Feedback on Golazo Stack

When speaking with the Golazo Community, I can accross a very nice idividia (TAG) who helped me learn the ropes on Laliga Golazo and what makes it special, I have always loved Football, but Golazo takes fan's love for the game to a new level never done before. Users though would love to be able to do more with their Moments, while still trying to keep the balance between gamifying Moments and making them better as Collectables that dont become useless upon the appearance of new Series.
